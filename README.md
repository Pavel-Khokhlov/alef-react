### Description

Project has been created according to FIGMA design.

This project has two pages:
1. Form - for modifing profile information (you can add only 5 children in your profile).
2. Preview - for looking saved profile.

Created two functions to:
1. set the first letter of name to UPPER case
2. set correct word (год, года, лет) after age

This project hasn't a backend side. I have disided to save info to LocalStorage.

### FUTURE

Create Form Validation, disable submit button.
In real project we need to create async request to save profile on server.
